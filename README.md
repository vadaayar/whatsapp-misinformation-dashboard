# 📊 WhatsApp Misinformation Dashboard

A data-driven dashboard built to analyze the spread of image-based misinformation across WhatsApp groups in India — particularly during politically sensitive periods such as the 2019 general elections.

This project is part of the **Digital Public Spheres** course at Constructor University and was developed by **Harish Kummara**, under the guidance of **Prof. Larsen Mandi**.
